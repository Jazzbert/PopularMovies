# Popular Movies Project for Udacity
Written by Craig Cleveland

## Summary
This is my *first* Android project created from scratch.  Thanks for taking a look!

This app pulls a list of the most popular movies and shows the poster for them.  You can click on the movie poster to get more info about the movie.  ...well, that's the goal when it's done. :)

## API Key
**Note:** the API key for accessing [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org), is *not* included in this repository.

To make this code functional, you need to add your own API key as a string resource with the name `tmdbAPIKey`.  This can be in a separate values file or in an the existing strings file.  Just make sure not to fork and upload your API elsewhere!
